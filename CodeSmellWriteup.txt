- Bloater: Long Parameter List in the spawnEnemies() method of the StartCombat class. This method has four parameters,
           with one of them (damage) not being necessary. This code smell exists because we had not yet decided that we
           wanted to make the damage always 1. Because of this, we just created a parameter for damage.
           I fixed this code smell by removing the damage parameter from the method header. Additionally, I edited the
           spawnEnemies method by replacing any references to the old damage parameter with the constant value of 1.
           This allowed the spawnEnemies() method calls to be more concise and readable.
           
- Mysterious Name: Within the Enemy class and child classes (i.e. PurpleEnemy, OrangeEnemy, YellowEnemy) there was a 
           mysterious variable named "d". Since I was the one that wrote it I knew what it represented, but by leaving
           it in its current state my peers cannot comprehend what that variable represents. I left it there as a place
           holder, but forgot to change it in the later stages of my code. "d" is meant to represent damage, so to make 
           the code more comprehensible I changed the variable int d to int damage. Therefore, now it is more clear what
           this variables purpose is in our code. Therefore, I changed all instances of d in the Enemy class and child classes
           to damage.
