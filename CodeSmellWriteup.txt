- Bloater: Long Parameter List in the spawnEnemies() method of the StartCombat class. This method has four parameters,
           with one of them (damage) not being necessary. This code smell exists because we had not yet decided that we
           wanted to make the damage always 1. Because of this, we just created a parameter for damage.
           I fixed this code smell by removing the damage parameter from the method header. Additionally, I edited the
           spawnEnemies method by replacing any references to the old damage parameter with the constant value of 1.
           This allowed the spawnEnemies() method calls to be more concise and readable.
