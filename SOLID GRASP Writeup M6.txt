Information Expert: An example of the GRASP princple Information Expert can be seen in the upgrade() methods in RedTower.java, BlueTower.java, and GreenTower.java. This code
                    follows this principle because instead of trying to manually upgrade towers when handling the upgrade button getting pressed in the MainGame class, we are
                    assigning the upgrade responsibility for each type of tower to their respective tower classes. We are doing this because these classes have the relevant
                    information, such as damage, slowMultiplier, and healthIncrement, that is necessary to fulfill our upgrade responsibility.
