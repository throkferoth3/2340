- checkAttackersEmpty(): This unit test checks to see that for a newly created Enemy object, its attackers list is
  initially empty. Additionally, by doing this, the test also verifies that the list is not initially null. This test
  is relevant because it covers the time period when an enemy has just been created and has yet to be attacked.

- testAddAttackers(): This unit test verifies that the addAttacker() method is working properly. In other words, it
  is making sure that we are able to add towers to the attackers list when an enemy is attacked. THis test is relevant
  because it verifies an extremely important functionality involved in the combat stages of the game.
