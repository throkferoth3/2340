We decided to use the Factory design pattern for this project. The computers have similar processes to be built,
but can be made by different manufacturers. This allows us to have the different manufacturers which extend the
Manufacturer abstract class decide which Computer class to create. Therefore, we follow DIP as all dependencies
are to the abstract Manufacturer and Computer classes rather than to any concrete, specific manufacturer or computer.
