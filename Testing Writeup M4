checkEnemyColors: This unit test check that the three different types of enemies implemented do in fact have different colors. This test is relevant because it allows us
                  to confirm that our game GUI is visually consistant with our implementational intentions.
        
checkHealthFunctionalities: This unit test verifies that the health of the three different types of enemies can be propery accessed and altered. This test is relevant because it
                  confirms that the classes for each type of enemy correctly extend the abstract Enemy class, which will allow us to to make changes to the enemies' stats as the
                  game progresses.
