checkEnemyColors: This unit test check that the three different types of enemies implemented do in fact have different colors. This test is relevant because it allows us to confirm that our game GUI is visually consistent with our implementation intentions.
        
checkHealthFunctionalities: This unit test verifies that the health of the three different types of enemies can be properly accessed and altered. This test is relevant because it confirms that the classes for each type of enemy correctly extend the abstract Enemy class, which will allow us to make changes to the enemies' stats as the game progresses.

checkEnemyHealth: This unit test verifies that the enemy's have there designated health. This shows that the enemy's all have the correct health.

checkEnemyDamage: This unit test verfies that the enemy's have there designated damage values. This shows that the enemy's all deal a different amount of damage. 

checkReset: This unit test sets the difficulty, changes the money, and then resets the game to check that the money is changed back to the initial value. This test is relevant because the game needs to be reset properly after the player triggers a game over.

checkDifferingHealth: This unit test verifies that every enemy has a different amount of health. This test is relavent because it shows that there is variation between the different enemies.

playerTakeDamage: This unit test sets the difficulty to easy and has the player take 1 damage. Then it checks to see if the playerInfo changed accordingly. This test is relevant because if the player info did not change correctly, the player's actual health did not decrease.

checkEnemyShape: This unit test creates 1 of each type of enemy and checks to see if they are all the correct shape. This test is relevant because we want all the enemies to be a circle type shape. It may cause bugs later on when we try to change the size of the enemy but fail because the shape is not correct.
