For the testing process, we first compared the string output from getCost() and getDescription() with the first
example string output in the final exam description. In order to get the exact string output, we had to combine
the 2 strings from getCost() and get Description with the " $" string in between. Then we used the wrapper classes
to create a double vanilla scoop of ice cream with sprinkles and hot fudge, and then we compared the output with the
example to check if they were the same.
