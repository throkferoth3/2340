For the testing process, we first compared the string output from getCost() and getDescription() with the first
example string output in the final exam description. In order to get the exact string output, we had to combine
the 2 strings from getCost() and get Description with the " $" string in between. Then we used the wrapper classes
to create a double vanilla scoop of ice cream with sprinkles and hot fudge, and then we compared the output with the
example to check if they were the same. The next test we did was making a single scoop vanilla ice cream with double
sprinkles. This is an edge case that the example test cases did not account for. We instantiated it and compared the
output with the expect output to check if they were the same. After that, we created a 2 scoop chocolate ice cream
with 0 toppings. This was another edge case the examples did not cover. It should just cost the base amount. Then we
tested having a large number of toppings on the ice cream with many duplicate toppings. We calculated the expected cost
and pre-wrote the description to compare with the result.
