- checkAttackersEmpty(): This unit test checks to see that for a newly created Enemy object, its attackers list is
  initially empty. Additionally, by doing this, the test also verifies that the list is not initially null. This test
  is relevant because it covers the time period when an enemy has just been created and has yet to be attacked.

- testAddAttackers(): This unit test verifies that the addAttacker() method is working properly. In other words, it
  is making sure that we are able to add towers to the attackers list when an enemy is attacked. THis test is relevant
  because it verifies an extremely important functionality involved in the combat stages of the game.
  
- testDeleteEnemy(): This unit test verifies that the enemies are deleted after their health is 0. This is done by checking
  if the object that is created is now null. This test is relevant because it verifies that the enemies are removed from the 
  map after they are reduced to 0 health. 
  
- testEnemyHealthIndicator(): This unit test verifies that the enemies have a visible health indicator. This is done by asserting
  that the Text object is not null indicating that the health indicator is present. This is relevant because it verifies that 
  we have a health indicator that can be viewed by the player. 

- testCreateInitText(): This test verifies that the initial health text of the enemies is correct. The various enemies have
  differing healths. This method creates the text that will later be displayed to the player on each enemy. It compares
  the expected string of text with the actual text to ensure that it matches.

- testCreateDisplay(): This test checks to see if the enemy display consists of a circle with text stacked on top of it.
  It creates the display with the corresponding method and checks that the child at index 0 is a Circle and the child at
  index 1 is text.
