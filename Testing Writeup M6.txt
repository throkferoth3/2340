testIsUpgradedBecomesTrue(): This test checks to make sure that the isUpgraded value for a Tower object becomes true whenever the tower is upgraded. This is important and
                             relevant to the implementation requirements because the user is not able to upgrade a tower more than once, so letting the system know that a tower
                             is already upgraded is extremely crucial.
testStatsChangedAfterUpgrade(): This test is making sure that for each of the different types of towers, their specific stats were changed after being upgraded. For instance,
                                the test confirms that a RedTower's damage is changed, a BlueTower's slowMultiplier is changed, and a GreenTower's healthIncrement is changed.
                                This is very relevant to the implementation requirements because the whole point of the upgrade functionality in our tower defense game is to
                                alter these specific stats.
testInitFinalBossStats(): This test checks that the boss' initial stats are correct when he spawns. It specifically checks his size, health and damage. The final boss'
                          size, health, and damage should be greater than the size, health, and damage of the other enemies. It is relevant to the implementation
                          requirements because the requirements state that the final boss should be visually/descriptively distinct from other enemies.
testFinalBossRound(): This test checks that the 3rd round is the final boss round. The boss should spawn after 3 rounds. It loops 3 times and sets the round number to the
                      current iteration of the loop. The method should return false if not at the 3rd round and true if at the 3rd round. This is relevant to the implementation
                      requirements because the requirements state that the boss should appear after some time playing the game.
testUpgradeTracking(): This test creates one of each tower type and checks that the upgrades purchased stat is at its correct initial value of 0. It then upgrades the towers and checks that the upgrades purchased stat is increased to 3. This is relevant to the implementation requirements because it checks that one of the 3 stats tracked over the course of the game is working correctly.
testResetStats(): This test creates a tower, upgrades it, and deals damage to the player. It then checks that each stat has been incremented to the correct value. It then calls the resetStats() method to reset all the stats to 0 and checks that all the stats have been reset. This is relevant to the implementation requirements because the resetting the stats is needed when starting a new game after either a game over or victory.
